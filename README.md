# Project-Proteomics-early-cancer-detection-enhanced-by-deep-learning
proteomics early cancer detection enhanced by deep learning is a project under course DTI-300 under the guidance of Ms.NIDHI SHARMA. This project is in progress with group of four members (SACHIN,KRIT,AKSHAT,DAKSH). the project will be able to detect early cancer in a human body which will be easier to treat in early stages.
