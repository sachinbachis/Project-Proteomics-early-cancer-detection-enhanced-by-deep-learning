# Project-Proteomics-early-cancer-detection-enhanced-by-deep-learning
Proteomics early Cancer Detection Enhanced by Deep Learning is a project under course DTI (Design Thinking and Innovation)under the guidance of Ms.NIDHI SHARMA. This project is in progress with a group of four members (SACHIN,KRIT,AKSHAT,DAKSH). The project will be able to detect early cancer in a human body which will be easier to treat in early stages.
